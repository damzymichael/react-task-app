# react-task-app

Hello Fellows in respect to your mini project.  Here's an outline of the project:

	
## Set up the project:	
Create a new React project using Create React App or your preferred method.
		
Set up the necessary project structure and files.
	


## Create Components:
Create a TaskForm component that allows users to input task details and submit the form.
		
Create a TaskList component that displays a list of tasks.
		
Create a TaskItem component that represents an individual task in the list.
	
	
	
	
## Implement Task Management:	
In the main App component, manage the state of tasks using the useState hook.
		
Add a function to handle adding new tasks.
		
Add a function to handle deleting tasks.
		
Add a function to handle marking tasks as completed.
	
	
	
	
## Render Components and Implement Functionality:	
Render the TaskForm component to allow users to add new tasks.
		
Render the TaskList component and pass the list of tasks as a prop.
		
In the TaskList component, map over the tasks and render a TaskItem component for each task.
		
Implement functionality in the TaskItem component to delete tasks and mark them as completed.
	
	
	
	
## Style the Application:
Add CSS or use a styling library/framework like Bootstrap to style the components and make the application visually appealing.
	
	
	
	
## Test the Application:
Test the functionality of adding tasks, deleting tasks, and marking tasks as completed.
		
Verify that the application renders and behaves as expected.
	
	

By following these steps, you'll create a simple task manager application using React. This project will allow you to practice various concepts, including component creation, state management, event handling, prop passing, and rendering lists dynamically.

Feel free to customize and enhance the project further based on your requirements and preferences. Happy coding!
